### Priniciple One: Reciprocity

- Beware of free gifts from strangers. 
- Malicious individuals will gift free things to others so that their victims will feel more compelled to return a gift of greater or equal value.
- These malicious individuals will seek to give "gifts" that the victim likes, ensuring that the target will grant the request with little to no thought.
- If a gift is truly free, there should typically be no strings attached. 
- A common tourist scam in France is where the scammer pretends to be a fashion designer, and as part of the scam, give you cheap clothing. Often times, this gift is not free, instead, the scammer will ask for something in return, mainly cash. Typically, the cash that's given by the victim to the scammer is worth more than the cheap clothing, leaving the victim with cheap, worthless clothing.

### Principle Two: Obligation
- Whereas, reciprocation is the feeling of indebtedness due to a gift or something of value that creates the action, obligation is that same feeling, but it's based on social norms or expected behaviors.
- Social norms could be defined as the informal rules that govern behavior. 
- Our obligation to societal norms are powerful, and often something that we don't consider as method in which attackers can attack from, but don't be fooled.
- Social engineers and malicious individuals want you to play into these expected reactions. This means that something as simple as holding the door could be weaponized to gain entry into a space where an individual shouldn't be. 
- While it might seem rude, we don't have obligations to strangers or individuals we don't know. Even the nicest stranger must go through the proper channels to enter a building. And a true gift is one that doesn't require reciprocation.

### Principle Three: Concession
- Malcious parties use the principle of concession to make the victim think it "their idea" to take the action they want. Examples include:
	- Giving confidential information away to the malicious party
	- offering favors to the malicious party
- ![concession](https://i.imgur.com/X9iP8Dv.png)
- Often, these malicious parties use minor, or smaller, requests that lead up to a larger request. 
- It's important to remind ourselves about the use of concession, and stand by rules and guidelines laid out by our employers or by ourselves.
	- We can make guidelines for ourselves like:
		- refusing to disclouse confidential information over the phone
		- refuse to offer favors to strangers with potentially nefarious motivations
		- refusing to grant access to our homes to strangers
	- By creating hard guidelines, and sticking to them no matter what, we can better protect ourselves from falling victim to concessions which favor attackers.

### Principle Four: Scarcity
- ![scarcity](https://i.imgur.com/6pRN12B.png)
- Scarcity can come in many forms, including time - like being late for an appointment or meeting, the final day of a sale, a time-limited vacation offer. 
- Social engineers use scarcity to make their bait seem more valuable to the victim, and influence them to make decisions based on that perceived value.
- Simply put, that time-limited vacation offer, isn't quite as rare or scarce as the marketer or social engineer would have you believe.
- Nowadays, hackers and other malicious individuals will use scarcity in the form of calls, emails, and even text messages. These individuals will impersonate credit companies, government agencies, or even nigerian princes in order to offer time-limited offers to potential victims.
	- In most of these cases, it's okay to hang up or not answer the email/call/text message, and contact the company/government agency through official channels. That way you can verify the demands from the company and get more information from an official source.
		- Never give payment information out over the phone, even if the situation is "urgent" or the individual on the other side of the phone is threatening you with jail time.
- Some more professional social engineers will use scarcity in the form of time. A great example of this:

### Principle Five: Authority
- Anyone will do anything when someone with a perceived authority asks them. At least, that's what malicious actors want us to think. When it comes to imitation, those who have malintent will use whatever manipulative methods necessary in order to trick unsuspecting victims.
- A great example of this type of social engineering practice is when scammers imitate the IRS to trick unsuspecting victims into giving them payments on "unpaid taxes". 
	- Often, these same individuals will claim that the victim will spend time in jail if the "taxes" go unpaid. But the truth is that there is no risk of jail time, instead, it's the malicious caller that is running the risk of being arrested.
- If you feel concerned about the caller, it's okay to call the agency or company directly to figure out if the call was legitimate or not. 
- A video of scam center in action - notice how the scammer imitates a government agent in trying to gain information about the victim.

### Principle Six: Cosistency and Commitment
- Why is consistency important to us? We want to seem like we are consistent, because consistency is a sign of confidence and strength
- Compliance drastically increases when the person has agreed to something smaller first
- When you blend compliance with the principle of consistency, it is an unstoppable force
- ![consistency](https://i.imgur.com/TfuAPsd.png)
- Social engineers play on the target's desire to remain consistent to their commitments, whether physical or mental. They want us to agree to little things at first, then will add larger requests down the line. 
- Typically as individuals, we view consistency as a sign of confidence and strength. We might comply with certain requests from scammers at first, but we have to draw a line on when to stop compling and recognize when 
- Here is a great example of commitment and consistency in action

### Prinicple Seven: Liking
- Often times, scammers will try to build their rapport with victims through conversation. 
- ![liking-example](https://i.imgur.com/CyTsalT.png)
- To help encourage this feeling, they look for ways to give a compliment and mirror body language and/or verbal cues to help the victim feel warm and fuzzy toward them.
- Often times, the best way to counteract this type of approach is to always be cautious, and be weary of others who seem overly nice. 
---

### Principle Eight: Social Proof
- When we are lost, confused, or unsure, we generally look to others to see how they are acting for cues (social proof) for what we should be doing.
- Social proof is one of the most influential ways that malicious parties are able to gain access to information or areas where they don't belong. 
- To ensure that we aren't victims of social proofing, we simply need to follow what we know is right. Even if the individual claims that your friend has been previously contacted, stick with what you know is right, and the chances of being a victim lowers dramatically.
